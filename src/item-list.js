  { heading: 'What are Crypto Ricks?', content: "CryptoRicks is a collection of NFTs, inspired by the show Rick and Morty. We love the show and know that it has a huge fanbase. We wanted to give ourselves as well as the fanbase the opportunity to express their love for the show and artwork on the Ethereum blockchain!" },
  { heading: 'But wait, what about copyright?', content: 'We’ve taken care to avoid using any trademarks or copyrighted art. While some of our art resembles copyrighted artwork (this is due to the nature of the project’s inspiration), we strongly believe our designs fall under parody fair use. However, should copyright owners feel otherwise, this project will become an interesting experiment in decentralization. Our NFTs live on Arbitrum, and all artwork is hosted on IPFS. Fans and holders of Crypto Ricks are encouraged to host the artwork on their own IPFS nodes in order to ensure its availability.' },
  { heading: 'Where can I find Crypto Ricks?', content: "Crypto Ricks are available for minting on this website. There is currently no NFT marketplace on Arbitrum, but we are building our own marketplace to account for this until OpenSea or another marketplace supports Arbitrum." },
  { heading: 'Does the team keep any Crypto Ricks?', content: 'The team will be minting 50 Ricks for giveaways, marketing, and team members.' },
  { heading: 'Do Crypto Ricks have any utility?', content: 'Once all Crypto Ricks have been minted, the team will be setting up a treasury with a portion of the funds to donate to charity. Crypto Ricks holders will get to vote on what charity those funds are donated to. We are also developing a PVP based game that will allow you to customize Ricks and Weapons to fight other Rick holders. This gets released once the first 3000 Rcks are minted!' },
